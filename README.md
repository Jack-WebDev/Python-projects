# Frontend Mentor - Python Projects

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my python projects.

An extra S/O to FreeCodeCamp, Kylie Ying and Tech with Tim.

## Overview

These are my very first Python projects. I really enjoyed it doing them. I may have fallen in love with back-end development.
